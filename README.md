# tACS Temporal Interference

Simulations of the distribution of the temporally interfering electric field are made on the human brain using a _Simple Anthropomorphic model_ **(SAM)** and realistic brain models from the [PHM](https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/regional-human-models/phm-repository/) repository.
